    "\n",
    "the value can be negative for bad stumps, which will vote in the exact opposite direction\n",
    "\n",
    "a graphical plot of **amount of say** against the **total error** looks like a verticalized **sigmoid** function\n",

    "### smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "done to prevent `total error` to be exact 1 or 0\n",

    "### resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "whenever a sample is classified incorrect, more weight is given to it\n",
    "\n",
    "`equation incorrect` $\\text{new sample weight} = \\text{sample weight} * e^{\\text{amount of say}}$\n",

    "\n",
    "In a **forest of stumps** made with **Adaboost**, some stumps gets more weight / are more important than others\n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which the stumps are made is important, unlike what happens in **Random Forest**"
